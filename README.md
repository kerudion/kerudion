### Hi ðŸ‘‹
I'm Kerudion - Minecraft mods, plugins and resource packs developer.
Currently I've created only one mod - [Chunks Fade In](https://modrinth.com/mod/chunks-fade-in), which has 1,25m+ downloads on [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/chunks-fade-in) and 150k+ on [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/chunks-fade-in).

But, of course, I won't stop and I'll create even more content!
